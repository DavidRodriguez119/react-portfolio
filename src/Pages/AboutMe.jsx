                    My name is David Santiago Rodriguez, thank you for visiting my portafolio. I am a 23 year old Colombian, currently taking a coding bootcamp at the University of Toronto.
                    I have a background of Mechanical Engineering studies at Conestoga College and 2 years of work experiance as a Drafting and Quality Technician at Planitar Inc.
                    I finally give myself the change to learn to code. It rapidly became one of my passions, and I invite you to scroll down and see what I have learn so far.
